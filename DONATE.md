Devastating earthquakes have struck Turkey twice. The first earthquake had a magnitude of 7.8, while the second one measured 7.5. These earthquakes have also caused severe destruction in Syria. Not only buildings and vehicles collapsed and were destroyed, but the earthquakes also claimed many lives. In the latest development, the total death toll in both countries (Turkey and Syria) has reached 3,823 people, with 14,500 people injured, and nearly 4,900 buildings reduced to rubble due to the earthquake.

According to the Turkish Disaster Management Authority, over 12,000 people are injured, while Syria reported at least 3,411 injured individuals.

Many toddlers are trapped under the debris, and rescue teams are facing difficulties in evacuating victims due to snow-covered locations and extreme cold weather.
